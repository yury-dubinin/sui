 Many examples can also be found in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/tree/main/crates/sui-graphql-rpc/examples). For example, in that folder you can find examples on [transaction block effects](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/tree/main/crates/sui-graphql-rpc/examples/transaction_block_effects), [protocol configs](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/tree/main/crates/sui-graphql-rpc/examples/protocol_configs), [stake connection](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/tree/main/crates/sui-graphql-rpc/examples/stake_connection), and more. Each folder contains one or more examples that you can use in your queries (see [here](./guides.mdx#querying-the-service) for how to query).
